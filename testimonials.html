                    "We were so lucky to have L.A.C.E. perform on our special day. Not only are they beautiful performers but beautiful people as well, extremely warm and friendly and a pleasure to work with. They did everything they could possibly do to make our day as enjoyable and special as possible. Throughout the ceremony you could hear a pin drop, Amy &amp; Louise captured everybodies attention from start to finish with their fantastic singing, violin and piano playing and gave the event a great atmosphere. I couldn't recommend L.A.C.E enough. Top class."<br><span class="dancing">Louise &amp; Shane - Radisson Blu Farnham Estate</span>

                    "L.A.C.E. came highly recommended and didn't disappoint! Thank you so much for the beautiful music you performed at our wedding. You made the day extra special for us, looking back on our dvd still gives me goosebumps to this day. We also had a family priest that married us on the day who was super impressed with how you performed."<br><span class="dancing">Stephanie &amp; Paul - Trim Castle</span>

                    "For my wedding, I booked L.A.C.E. for some music in the hotel for the drinks reception. I wanted something that everyone would relax to and enjoy over a few drinks, and they provided just that. Their classical music on the piano was a real hit and I got many compliments on it after our big day. Louise and Amy were excellent to work with and were very willing to suit our needs on the day. They were very reliable and always kept in touch prior to our big day which made it very easy for me. I would definitely recommend L.A.C.E. to any clients looking for some tasteful music on their big day."<br><span class="dancing">Sinead Murphy</span>
